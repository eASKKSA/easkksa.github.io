Karate was popularised and introduced in secondary schools before the Second World War.",
      "transition": "Like many Japanese martial arts, Karate made its transition to <b>Karate-do</b> at the start of the 20th century. The \"do\" (way) brings deep elements of Zen Buddhism to practice, sometimes called \"Zen in motion\". Modernisation also included the adoption of the white uniform (<b>keikogi</b>) and coloured belts to indicate grade, both popularised by Jigoro Kano, founder of Judo."
